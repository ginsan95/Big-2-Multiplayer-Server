# Big-2-Multiplayer-Server
This project is a multiplayer Big 2 game written in Scala and used the AKKA middleware framework.
It is my assignment for the subject Distributed System during my undergraduate semester 7.

This project consists of 2 modules, where this is the server side, which is used to allow the players to connect to the server and search for other available players and game rooms.
For the client module, it can be found in the link below:

This game only works for playing in a LAN. If you wish to play over the Internet, the host of the game room will have to perform port forwarding. The port is 6767 for communicating with the server.
